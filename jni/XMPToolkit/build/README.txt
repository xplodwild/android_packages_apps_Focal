This README describes steps to generate project files on different platforms.These platform specific projects can then be used to build the XMPToolkit SDK.Before generating the projects the SDK developer needs to copy dependencies to the proper locations. Refer to "Dependencies" section in XMP Toolkit Programmer's Guide.

WINDOWS XP and above
Options to generate Project files in Windows is of the form "Generate XMPSDKToolkit [Dynamic|static] [Win32|x64]".An option of "Dynamic" indicates that the generated project files will build a dll for the XMP SDK components.On the other hand the option of "Static" indicates that the generated project files will build a static lib for the XMP SDK components.Options for "Win32" or "x64" indicates that the generated project files will build the library for 32 bit or 64 bit applications respectively. 
1. Open the windows command prompt and change the current directory to <xmpsdk>/build.2. Run the batch file GenerateXMPToolkitSDK_win.bat. There will be four options(2-5) to build projects for different configurations, one option(6) to generate projects for all configurations and one option(1) to clean all the projects.3. After running the batch file (options 2-6),the vc10 projects(using cmake) will be generated at the location <xmpsdk>/build/vc10/<static|dynamic>/<windows|windows_x64>/<XMPToolkitSDK.sln|XMPToolkitSDK64.sln>.4. Open the visual studio solution file and build XMP Toolkit SDK for debug/release configuration.
MAC OS X 10.6 and above
Options to generate Project files in Mac is of the form "Generate XMPSDKToolkit [Dynamic|static] [32|64|iOS]".An option of "Dynamic" indicates that the generated project files will build a framework for the XMP SDK components.On the other hand the option of "Static" indicates that the generated project files will build a static lib for the XMP SDK components.Options for "32" or "64" indicates that the generated project files will build for 32 bit or 64 bit applications respectively. The option of "iOS" will generate the project files that will build XMP Core library for iOS simulators and iOS devices.
1. Open the Terminal on Mac and change the current directory to <xmpsdk>/build.2. Run the shell script GenerateXMPToolkitSDK_mac.sh. There will be five options(2-6) to build projects for different configurations, one option(7) to generate projects for all configurations and one option(1) to clean all the projects.
3. After running the batch file (options 2-7),the xcode projects will be generated(using cmake) at the location <xmpsdk>/build/xcode/<static|dynamic>/<intel|intel_64>/<XMPToolkitSDK.xcodeproj|XMPToolkitSDK64.xcodeproj>.
4. Open the xcodeproj file and build XMP Toolkit SDK for debug/release configuration.
Note: When multiple Xcode versions are installed on a system, the developer has to use xcode-select command to specify the  Xcode version that he wishes to use.This is done in two steps by fetching the current Xcode folder and changing it if required.
1) Fetch the current Xcode folder	$ xcode-select -print-path
2) Change the Xcode Folder if required.For example if the new XCode path is /Applications/Xcode.app	$ sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/DeveloperNote: Presently a single scheme is created for each project. For building different configurations the Release or Debug configurations has to be selected using "Edit Scheme -> Run -> Release/Debug
LINUX
Options to generate makefiles in Linux is given in the form of a Makefile with different targets.The targets available are
StaticAll: Generate the Makefiles for static libraries and build them. Includes both Debug and Release libs.DynamicAll: Generate the Makefiles for shared libraries and build them. Includes both Debug and Release libs.DebugAll: Generate the Makefiles for Debug libraries and build them. Includes both static and dynamic libs.ReleaseAll: Generate the Makefiles for Release libraries and build them. Includes both static and dynamic libs.
1. Change the current directory to <xmpsdk>/build.2. Make sure the gcc location is added to $PATH and its libraries location to $LD_LIBRARY_PATH. There is a need to add libuuid.so library path to the $LD_LIBRARY_PATH as well.
3. This <xmpsdk>/build folder contains a Makefile which has different targets to build and the default is to build all of them.The Makefile generates the makefiles(using cmake) to build the project and then calls these makefiles to build the target. 

Note: Generating gcc Makefiles to build the project requires the path to the gcc set in the CMake toolchain file for Linux i.e. <xmpsdk>/build/shared/ToolchainGCC.cmake. In this file modifications must be done by the developer to set the CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH so that CMake picks the desired gcc compiler. He may also want to change the parameter XMP_ENABLE_SECURE_SETTINGS as per the configured gcc.
 a) If the gcc is configured with --enable-libssp (can be checked by executing gcc -v), he has to set the variable XMP_GCC_LIBPATH inside of file <xmpsdk>/build/XMP_Linux.cmake to the path containing the static lib( libssp.a).In this case he can set the variable the XMP_ENABLE_SECURE_SETTINGS on.
b) If the gcc is configured with --disable-libssp, he has to set the variable XMP_ENABLE_SECURE_SETTINGS off.
=================================================================================================================================================Note: The projects for different platforms are now generated using CMake. CMake generates projects with absolute paths so they cannot be copied from one place to other. If the projects is to be moved then whole tree has to be copied to the new location and CMake should be invoked again
